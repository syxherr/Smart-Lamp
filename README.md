# Smart-Lamp

Creating an Arduino device capable of controlling on/off switches for lamps via a local web using the ESP8266 module.

## Tools and Materials:
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- 4-color lamps
- 4-channel relay module
- Jumper wires
- USB cable
- Power source & electrical cables
- Adapter
  
## Steps to Create the Project:
- Develop the program to control the lamps by using the code in my repository
- Upload it to the NodeMCU ESP8266 using the USB cable.
- Connect the jumper wires between the NodeMCU and the relay module according to the required configuration.
- Connect the lamps using the electrical cables.
- Attach the lamp cables to the relay module.
- Connect the relay module to the adapter.
- Provide power to the NodeMCU using the USB cable.
- Plug the adapter into an electrical outlet to power the lamps.
- The lamps can now be controlled via a web browser.
