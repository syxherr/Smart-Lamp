1. Develop the program to control the lamps by using the code in my repository
2. Upload it to the NodeMCU ESP8266 using the USB cable.
3. Connect the jumper wires between the NodeMCU and the relay module according to the required configuration.
4. Connect the lamps using the electrical cables.
5. Attach the lamp cables to the relay module.
6. Connect the relay module to the adapter.
7. Provide power to the NodeMCU using the USB cable.
8. Plug the adapter into an electrical outlet to power the lamps.
9. The lamps can now be controlled via a web browser.
